# Orb

CircleCI has introduced the concept of reusable config in the form of [Orbs](https://circleci.com/orbs/).  As of lamb v5.1, danielpickens publishes an orb called [`danielpickens/lamb`](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/danielpickens/lamb) in order to provide easier configuration inside of CircleCI.
